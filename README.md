# Gold Price Prediction

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting gold prices using machine learning techniques. Gold prices are influenced by a variety of economic, geopolitical, and market factors, making them an interesting subject for prediction. By building a predictive model, we aim to forecast future gold prices based on historical data.

## Technology Used
![InteloneAPI](https://github.com/Pavankurapati03/Gold_Price_Prediction/assets/124707043/30ee0bf4-d821-4871-9eeb-f47dcfc431af)
The IntelÂ® OneAPI toolkit - Linear regression, naive bayes , Exponential Smoothening enables models to be trained in a more efficient way and results in faster training times. 


## Project Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project is to leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze historical gold price data and make informed predictions about future gold prices. Accurate price predictions can be valuable for investors, traders, and financial analysts who want to make data-driven decisions in the gold market.

## Data

The project uses historical gold price data from reliable sources such as https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nhiyen/monthly-gold-price. This dataset contains information about gold prices over a specific time period and date.

## Methodology

The project follows these key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, handling missing data, and feature engineering.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to gain insights into gold price trends and patterns.

3. **Feature Selection:** Identifying relevant features that contribute to gold price prediction.

4. **Machine Learning Model:** Building and training a machine learning model, such as linear regression and naive bayes for caluclating the accuracy score of training and testing,Exponential smoothening for time series forecasting, to predict gold prices.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluating the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.

6. **Prediction:** Making future gold price predictions using the trained model.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need [numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,sklearn for importing the exponential smoothening,linear regression and naive bayes]. You can install them using the following command:

- !pip install numpy
- !pip install pandas)
